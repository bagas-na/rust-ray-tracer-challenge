# Rust Ray Tracer

This is my attempt at implementing a ray tracer renderer in Rust, following the excellent guide from [*The Ray Tracer Challenge*](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/) by Jamis Buck.

The goal of this project is to build a fully functional ray tracer from scratch, using only the Rust standard library where possible.
